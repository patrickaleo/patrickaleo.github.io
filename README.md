AI/ML Researcher for Time-Domain Science in Astronomy

**NOTE:** This page is under development. Come back later for more!

<a href="test.html">Page 1</a>

I work with the goal of advancing our understanding of the universe by way of identifying and characterizing astronomical events, particularly the violent explosive deaths of stars called supernovae. My research interests include time-series analysis, anomaly detection, deep learning, data mining, and data visualization.
